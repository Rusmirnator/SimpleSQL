# SimpleSQL

This project originated due to need for postgres sql admin tool capable of running on arm64 and win64 architecture based platforms. I was having some troubles with running pgAdmin on my raspberry pi and i wanted to dive in into TypeScript and Angular, so i decided to write my own tool.

It is my TS/Angular training ground at this moment.
